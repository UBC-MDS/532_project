## Motivation and Purpose

Today we have men and women working together in many fields, be it offices , hospitals or field work. This was not same few decades back.
In the past there was a time when some jobs were male dominated, and females were reluctant to join those sectors. However, with time women broke many social norms and entered almost all the sectors.
Also, there are sectors which were jobs which women never performed earlier, but once they entered that sector, those sectors became female dominated. In order to see this change, we are creating this app
which will show how technology or the needs of society led to change in popularity of different jobs and how these sectors changed for men and women.

## Dataset

We will be visualizing a dataset containing 7500 observations. This
dataset contains 5 variables. The column (`job`) specifies the jobs
represented in the dataset, which are 250 jobs. Two genders have been
considered; men and women and listed in the column (`sex`). The data was
collected in 2001, for the years from 1850 till 2000 represented in a
10-year time step in a column (`year`). The reported number of
employments for each gender is represented in the (`count`) column. A
percentage of the count of employment of a job over the total count of
employment of all the jobs for a specific decade is showed in a column
(`perc`).

## Research Questions

- What are the top 10 highest occupied jobs by men?
- What is the trend of the total count of each job over the years?
- What is the trend of the total job count between males and females of each job overtime?
- What is the proportion of total women and men workers overtime?


### Usage scenarios:

Katherine is an job analyzer and occupation researcher who is interested to know the trend of the total number of high men occupied jobs overtime, especially in the past ten decades. She wants to be able to [explore] a dataset in order to [compare] the trend of the total job count between different occupations. She is also eager to [identify] and [report] the differences of the total job count between males and females of a particular job overtime. It might also be helpful if Katherine can [find out] how the proportion of total female and male workers change over the period. When Katherine clicks into the “Job Count Overtime app”, she will see some of the most popular jobs during 1850 to 2000 in “tab1”. The total number of jobs by occupation are presented as a heatmap so that she can see which jobs are more popular than others. Katherine could also see the actual total count according to sex of a certain job in a specific year by using the slider to drag between “women” and “men”.  If she wants to [examine] a particular job, she can click on “tab2” to see the differences between the female and male counts overtime by using the dropdown function. If Katherine is curious about the proportion of female and male workers overtime, she can go to “tab3” to visualize the bar plots and click on an individual bar to see the actual percentage of a certain year. Katherine might notice that the number of women workers increases overtime to almost 50%. She hypothesizes that the proportion of women workers will stay stable for the next few decades.
