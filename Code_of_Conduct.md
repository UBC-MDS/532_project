#### Introduction

Code of conduct is necessary for promoting a healthy environment among the group while any group project is going on. It is not only limited to classes and labs but also when we are working off campus on any activity related to the project.

#### Expected Behavior:
In order to develop a healthy learning environment, we expected following behaviors from all our team members:
- Use of a language which everyone is comfortable with
- Accepting the fact that all of us are not on the same page in terms of technology
- Listen to the suggestions given by everyone
- Accept criticism and try to learn something from that
- Acknowledging the fact that other people might have different priorities at the time we have decided to plan a meeting
-  Acknowledging the fact that people living off campus might not be available at odd timings

#### Unexpected Behavior:
This kind of behavior will not be acceptable and can lead to serious repercussions:
- Making harsh comments on others work
- Using abusive language
- Racist comments or jokes
- Not listening to the suggestions or points made by other teammates.
- Pointing out others for their mistake in a rude manner
- Missing Deadlines

#### Consequences for unexpected behavior:
In case any team member is found indulging in any of these activities, the person is expected to stop doing that on being pointed out by other teammates. In case the person is still doing the same activity, team will report the issue to the lab instructor to take the appropriate actions.
