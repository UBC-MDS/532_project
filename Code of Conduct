#Team Contract

*High quality of work is expected from each team member. 
*Hesitance to give feedback and ideas has no place in our team.
*Work will be distributed equally and divided over the three team members.
*Brainstorming is the first step before executing the tasks; and it is our way to make sure that we collected the best ideas from all team members.
*We have two meeting every week, on Thursday and Friday.
*Meeting are attended in person and if it is not possible then remote meetings can be considered.
*Meetings Agendas and Minutes of meetings are assigned to two of the team members every meeting rotating the responsibility.
*Every member will submit their work as a pull request and will be reviewed by both team members and will be merged once all suggestions are considered. 
*When time is a constraint, we are giving an authorization for each team member to submit their work on the master repository without being reviewed by the rest of the team members.
